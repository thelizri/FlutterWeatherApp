## FlutterWeatherApp

This application is crafted using Flutter and integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates as well as forecasts for your current location. This project was a fun tiny exploration into the capabilities of Flutter.

Below you can see some pictures of the program running on the Pixel 7 Pro API 34 emulator in Android Studio.
